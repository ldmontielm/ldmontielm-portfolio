This project is a web application that allows users to explore characters, locations, and episodes from the Rick and Morty universe, developed to demonstrate the integration of Next.js 14.2.15, React, TypeScript, TanStack Query, Shadcn UI, and Tailwind CSS in a modern project. This is the first version, with new features planned for future updates.

## üöÄ Technologies Used
- **Next.js (v14.2.15)**: Used as the main framework for the project, leveraging its pages architecture, dynamic routing, and features like server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG).

- **React**: Used as the user interface library, creating reusable components and managing local state efficiently.

- **TypeScript**: Provides static typing throughout the codebase, enhancing maintainability and reducing errors during development.

- **TanStack Query**: Implemented to manage asynchronous data handling and caching efficiently, facilitating API requests and managing loading, error, and success states.

- **Axios**: Used as an HTTP client to make requests to the Rick and Morty API, leveraging its simplicity and advanced features such as interceptors and request cancellation.

- **Shadcn UI**: Used to build elegant and accessible UI components, providing a set of pre-built components that integrate seamlessly with Tailwind CSS.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Used as a utility-first CSS framework, enabling quick and responsive design with utility classes that simplify layout customization.

## ‚ú® Project Features
- **Character, Location, and Episode Exploration**: Allows users to browse and view detailed information about characters, their locations, and favorite episodes from Rick and Morty.

- **Efficient Data Management with TanStack Query**: API requests to the Rick and Morty API are managed with TanStack Query, which enables:
    - Automatic data caching for improved performance.
    - Optimized handling of loading and error states.
    - Data revalidation to ensure up-to-date information is displayed.

- **Performance Optimization with Next.js**: SSR and SSG are used to improve load times and optimize for search engines (SEO).

- **Interactive and Responsive User Interface**: Built with modular React components and Shadcn UI, along with Tailwind CSS, to deliver a smooth and user-friendly experience across mobile and desktop devices.
